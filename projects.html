        <h2>Current / Completed Projects</h2>
        <h3 >SkipList</h3>
    <p>Technologies: Java</p>
    <p>As a semester project, I was able to create a generic skip list data structure that worked well with integers, strings, and floating point values.
        The main goal of the project was to learn how to use different Java interfaces and libraries to implement something unique. The skip list included
        O(logn) operations such as: add, search, and delete; As well as O(n) operations such as: rebalance and hashCode. It required strong expierence
        with inheritance, incapuslation, and object-oriented programming.
    </p>
    
    <h3 >Mr.QR Discord Bot</h3>
    <p>Technologies: Python, Discord.py, qrcode.py</p>
    <p> As a fun personal project, I learned how to create a discord bot using python and python libraries such as: discord and qrcode. The purpose
        of the discord bot was for users to be able to create qr codes to share in servers or send to themselves. The idea of networking and the fact Discord is used by many
        as a way to connect inspired me to create this program.

        The active challenge of this project is hosting the discord bot 24/7 and finding ways for it to be more efficient.

    <h3>2-4 Tree Data Structure</h3>
    <p>Technologies: Java</p>
    <p> A 2-4 tree structure is a tree data stucture where each node has between two and four links to other nodes and between one and three values
        stored in each node. The main goal of this project was to be able to implement an advance data structure that maintained balance between both
        left and right side of the tree. Adding, searching, and deleting for this 2-4 tree were all O(logn) operation. This was by far one of the 
        hardest challenges and one where I learned alot.

    <h3>Personal ePortfolio Website</h3>
    <p>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
    <p> The portfolio website main purpose is to showcase myself and the projects I've been able to make. It contains basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    which makes it stand out to viewers. The website also includes links to important pages like LinkedIn, Github, and a webpage specifically for my projects.
    I look for to continue adding to the website making it as dynamic and appealing as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Projects</h2>
        <h3>Password Manager</h3>
    <p>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL</p>
    <p>Password managing programs are one of the safest ways a person can create different passwords for different applications without the worry
        of forgetting them. Making a project like this can help improve my knowledge and skills of implementing login systems and relational databases
        into my programs. A very educational project I look forward to starting in the future. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Google Chrome Extension</h3>
    <p>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs</p>
    <p> Google Chrome extensions are powerful and useful applications used by millions of google users. Creating a google chrome extension program can help me advance
        my skills in implementing APIs and given me more expierence with JavaScript. Even though I do not have an idea for an extension yet, I look
        forward to tackling this project in the future.
